# vue-graphql-example
Vue GraphQL Example Project

This project is made to demonstrate the basic setup of a project with VueJS + VueX + GraphQL + persisted locally stored data.

I do not claim that this is THE correct way to set these things up, but it works!

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
